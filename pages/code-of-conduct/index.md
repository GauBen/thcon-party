## THCon 2021 Code of Conduct

**All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at THCon are required to agree with the following code of conduct.** Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

The THCon team is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience and safe space for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
Sexual language and imagery, and any potentially offensive content is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, events, and social media in general aswell.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference at the discretion of the conference organisers.
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by their roles on the eventâ€™s Discord server.
Our team will be happy to help participants experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
We expect participants to follow these rules during the THCon.

Obviously, all types of attacks against the THCon's servers (DDos, etc) and infrastructures are also strictly forbidden.
