<h2 id="ctf">CTF Competition</h2>

**This year, we have decided to bring back THCon's hacking competition, the "Capture the Flag"!** Players will have to put their hacking skills into practice to **solve cybersecurity challenges**: exploit a flaw in a website, extract data embedded in a memory image, finding vulnerabilities in an encryption protocolâ€¦ The resolution of each challenge leads to a "flag", a validation password needed to win points.

The winning teams will **win fancy prizes** such as hacker equipment, t-shirts and many other surprises!
